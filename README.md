# 3D-KINECT-SCANNER
cuda implementation of a 3d scanner for the kinect v2. it is based on the kinectfusion paper. you can find it the paper folder.

## DEPENDENCIES ##
eigen
cuda 7.5
opencv3
[freenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2)
libusb
libncurses5-dev
ICPCUDA_dependecies

## BUILD ##
```
#!bash
cd path/to/3d-kinect-scanner
mkdir build data
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## RUN ##
```
#!bash
./3D-kinect-scanner
```

## USAGE ##
### initialize ###
use initialize to set the cube size and the voxel size. this affects the scanable objectsize.
it is however limited by the available memory on your gpu. for 2GB 480x480x480 seems to be the limit.
the voxelsize affects the resolution of the resulting mesh.
### scan ###
scan what you like
### save mesh ###
choose filename or default. you will find the result in path/to/3d-kinect-scanner/data
